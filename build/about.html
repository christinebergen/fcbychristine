              My name is Christine, it is the name I chose when I was 11. I knew
              I was a caregiver from very early on. <br /><br />In my 20's I was
              trained by an RN to help care for her complex care father to
              provide care in his own home. I learned skills that were quite
              involved and complex. This helped me figure out that I liked
              helping people and I loved the challenges of complex care. Shortly
              afterwards, I went to Malaspina University College (now Vancouver
              Island University) and finished the Home Support Residential Care
              Aid course in 1997 (now called Health Care Aid) and completed in
              the top 5. This led me to my first job in healthcare, a group home
              for high medical need clients, (most of the clients had challenges
              with cognitive differences, physical challenges, and high seizure
              activity). <br /><br />While working at the Group home I gained
              employment working with Quadreplegic and Paraplegic people living
              in the community. I learned a lot in those three years. I learned
              mostly that I need more education. So I went back to school and
              completed the Licensed Practical Nursing program in 2001.
              Immediately upon graduation I got a temporary line on the acute
              medical floor (floor 3) at Nanaimo Regional General Hospital for
              3years. I loved this work. It was intense. The learning curve was
              steep and the acuity was high. After the 3year line on the third
              floor I continue to work all over the hospital for approximately
              15 years. Rehab, Long Term Care, Emergency, Palliative, Portering,
              Acute Care, are all the places I worked, however, after all that
              time I was unable to find a permanent line. 2003 I had my first
              baby and in 2007 my second. Both beautiful girls. I was struggling
              to work as an on-call employee and as a new mom. This is when I
              made the decision to find other work. <br /><br />On a whim I
              dropped off a resume at a medical clinic in my neighbourhood and
              surprisingly started working the next week. I loved this job. I
              got to provide education to patients, provide wound care and
              general support to the physicians and staff alike. A couple of
              years later I was promoted to Manager. Also, at this time our
              Medical Director had 2 patients that had negative outcomes due to
              poor Foot Care, and this affected him deeply. He and I had worked
              together for a few years at this point and he knew that I loved
              education. He graciously offered to pay for my course if I would
              bring the skills into the clinic in hopes to never have another
              unnecessary negative outcome. I agreed and was lucky enough to
              work with VIHA afterwards working with low income and/or
              complex/chronic disease patients. This was an incredible
              experience. In 2018 the clinic had to close due to physician
              shortages and I opted to go out on my own. This was the start of
              my independent journey.

              The Next Chapter
            </h2>
            <p class="text-start text-md md:text-xl">
              All throughout my journey I was exposed to deaths in all of its
              forms, sudden, long, peaceful, and violent. I have had many
              conversations with medical personnel, families and friends of the
              dying and the dying themselves. I noticed that the people that had
              a lot of conversations around death and dying seemed to be more at
              peace in their final moments than those who hadn't. I also noticed
              that the more accepting of the inevitable outcome everyone
              involved was, the more calm and supported the dying seem to be.
              This has been a side note in everything I did as a nurse, as an
              observer and as caregiver or a person who truly cares. Along the
              way, I also have been blessed to have some discussions with my
              Foot Care Clients and realized that I was drawn to working with
              people around the dying process. This is my second calling and
              what I am working on currently. I am in the process of learning
              how to be an End of Life Doula.<br /><br />
              What is an End of Life Doula? An End of Life Doula is someone who
              supports people in the end of life. They help with discussions
              around death to empower, educate and encourage all who become
              involved in the process. Culturally in North America death is a
              taboo subject and considered negatively, or bad instead of part of
              the human experience. The End of Life Doula does not impose
              preconceived notions of death and dying upon the person and their
              family/friends rather they empower them to figure out what is
              important to them and how to create an experience that is
              meaningful to the person who is dying and their loved ones. A
              person does need to be actively dying or given a life limiting
              diagnosis to utilize an End of Life Doula. An End of Life Doula
              can be a part of the planning at any point. <br /><br />I look
              forward to continuing on this journey and hope to be able to
              provide this service in the near future. If you wish to learn more
              about End of Life Doula work please feel free to browse the
